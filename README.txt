NIHAL KHEMCHAND SHAHARE

I'VE MADE TIC TAC TOE ON GEDIT WITHOUT USING GRAPHICS.
IT RUNS ON A TERMINAL.
I USED STANDARD LIBRARY.
IN THIS CODE THERE ARE 6 FUNCTIONS AND A MAIN FUNCTION.
THIS GAME IS TWO PLAYER AS WELL AS ONE PLAYER GAME THAT IS AGAINST COMPUTER.
THERE IS PROPER GUIDENCE WHILE PLAYING THE GAME.
FOR RUNING THE CODE:
	RUN make

AND THEN 
	./project
